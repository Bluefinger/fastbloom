The fastest bloom filter in Rust. No accuracy compromises. Compatible with any hasher.


### Usage

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
fastbloom = "0.2.0"
```

```rust
use fastbloom::BloomFilter;

let num_bits = 1024;

let mut filter = BloomFilter::builder(num_bits).expected_items(2);
filter.insert("42");
filter.insert("ðŸ¦€");
```
Instantiate from a collection of items:
```rust
use fastbloom::BloomFilter;

let num_bits = 1024;

let filter = BloomFilter::builder(num_bits).items(["42", "ðŸ¦€"]);
assert!(filter.contains("42"));
assert!(filter.contains("ðŸ¦€"));
```
Use any hasher:
```rust
use fastbloom::BloomFilter;
use ahash::RandomState;

let num_bits = 1024;

let filter = BloomFilter::builder(num_bits)
    .hasher(RandomState::default())
    .items(["42", "ðŸ¦€"]);
```

### Background
Bloom filters are a space efficient approximate membership set data structure. False positives from a membership check are possible, but false negatives are not. [See more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter).

Blocked bloom filters are supported by an underlying bit vector, chunked into 512, 256, 128, or 64 bit "blocks", to track item membership. To insert, a number of bits are set at positions, based on the item's hash, in one of the underlying bit vector's block. To check membership, a number of bits are checked at positions, based on the item's hash, in one of the underlying bit vector's block. [See more on blocked bloom filters](https://web.archive.org/web/20070623102632/http://algo2.iti.uni-karlsruhe.de/singler/publications/cacheefficientbloomfilters-wea2007.pdf).

Once constructed, neither the bloom filter's underlying memory usage nor number of bits per item change.


### Implementation

`fastbloom` is **several times faster** than existing bloom filters and scales very well with number of hashes per item. In all cases, `fastbloom` maintains competitive false positive rates. `fastbloom` is blazingly fast because it uses L1 cache friendly blocks and efficiently derives many index bits from **only one hash per value**.

`fastbloom`'s default hasher is SipHash-1-3 using randomized keys, but can be seeded or configured to use any hasher.

### Runtime Performance

#### SipHash
Runtime comparison to other bloom filter crates (all using SipHash). Note, as number of items (input) increases, the accuracy of the bloom filter decreases. 1000 random strings were used to test membership.

#### Any Hash Goes
The fastbloom-rs crate (similarily named) uses xxhash, which faster than SipHash, so it is not fair to compare above. However, we can configure `fastbloom` to use similarly fast hash, ahash, and compare. 1000 random strings were used to test membership.

### False Positive Performance

`fastbloom` does not compromise accuracy. Below is a comparison of false positive rates with other bloom filter crates:
